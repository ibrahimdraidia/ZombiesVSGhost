ZombiesVSGhost
==============
For the project of the end of the year we had to create a simplified version of the game AngryBirds in C with the library EZ-Draw, to avoid the copyright stuff I decided to create this game with zombies and ghost but the idea stills the same as angrybirds.
shoot the ghost with zombies head...pretty cool
